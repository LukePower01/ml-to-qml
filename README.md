# ml-to-qml
Final year project, exploring the field of quantum machine learning.

## Quantum Machine Learning
Quantum Machine Learning (QML) expands what is capabble by classical computers by utillizing phenomenom found in quantum physics, such as entanglement and superposition. 

## The Qubit
The qubit is the quantum computing equivalent of the bit. What makes a qubit so special is that unlike a bit which is constrained to values of either 0 or 1, a qubit can be _simultaneously_ in 0 **and** 1 at the same time in a state called superposition.

## My Project Objectives
The focus of this project is to learn and the fundamental principles of QML, and to investigate what new inferences can be maade about classical data, that cannot be made with classical machine learning.

This will involve: 
- Investage the classical data in a normal manner
- Encode the classical features and labels to a quantum state representation
- Implement QML techniques and a method of measuring feature importance
- Compare and contrast the rankings of features by classical and quantum methods.
